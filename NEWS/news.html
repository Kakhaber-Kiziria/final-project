            <h1>The Xiaomi 15 could start a new generation of Android phones</h1>
            <p>It seems like there’s always a new chip being introduced for smartphones. Qualcomm is preparing to release its next Snapdragon mobile chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and there is a report that it could be featured in a new smartphone before the year ends. According to Digital Chat Station’s latest Weibo post, the Xiaomi 15 will perhaps be the first phone to launch with Qualcomm’s next chip. It’s the same chip that almost certainly will launch with the Samsung Galaxy S25 series early next year. According to Digital Chat Station, the Xiaomi 15 is expected to sport a 1.5K LTP display and come in two stylish finishes: pure white glass or pure vegan “patchwork” leather. The real star, however, is the camera system, which is rumored to include a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP vertical telephoto macro with 3X zoom.  On the performance front, the Xiaomi 15 is rumored to pack a punch with up to 16GB of RAM and a whopping 1TB of internal storage, offering ample space for all your files and apps. In addition, it could feature an enhanced stereo speaker setup, promising an immersive audio experience and a larger battery capacity, ensuring you stay connected for longer. Circling back to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, the incoming chip will almost certainly see improvements over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Qualcomm’s current flagship chip is on the Samsung Galaxy S24 series and OnePlus 12, among other devices. The forthcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4’s enhanced features may cost you more, however. A recent post on Weibo suggested that inflation might substantially raise the production expenses for the new chip. Consequently, consumers could potentially face a higher retail price. If the Xiaomi 15 launches around the same time that the Xiaomi 14 did, we can expect the phone to debut in China in October or November and to be released globally early next year.</p>

                <h1>This giant Galaxy Z Fold 6 leak just spoiled everything</h1>
                <p>We can’t go a day without a new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 leak. And today, there’s a significant one that may just cover the entire spec sheet for the upcoming device. And if this spec sheet is correct, some previous rumors might not be accurate. The specs come from Smartprix, which typically is correct on these matters. The upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 is rumored to have a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X inner display with a 2160 x 1856 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. It will also feature a 6.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X outer display with a resolution of 2376 x 968 and a 120Hz refresh rate. Until now, most rumors have suggested that the outer display would increase from 6.2 inches on the Galaxy Z Fold 5. However, they also indicated that the new model would have an outer display that is slightly wider and less narrow than the previous one. This may not be the case, as the latest model is said to present a 23:9 aspect ratio. Beyond this, the SmartPrix specs align with the previous rumors. The new foldable is likely to sport an octa-core Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip with 12GB of RAM and be offered with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage. The specs of the Galaxy Z Fold models aren’t supposed to change camera-wise. The triple-camera setup on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should include a 50-megapixel primary camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x digital zoom. A 12MP ultrawide camera is also expected. These cameras support autofocus and optical image stabilization. The camera under the display will have 4MP, while the camera on the cover will have 10MP. Earlier this week, SmartPrix reported that the prices for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 would increase by $100. The 256GB model would cost $1,899, the 512GB model $2,099, and the 1TB version $2,259. We should know the actual specs soon enough and see how they compare to these. Samsung is expected to announce the latest Z Fold, along with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Watch 7 at an Unpacked event in Paris on July 10.</p>

                <h1>Your Galaxy S22 is about to get an important security update</h1>
                <p>If you own a Samsung Galaxy S22, you should be on the lookout for a critical security update. Currently making its way to European users, the update should soon arrive for U.S. folks, too. The same June 2024 update was sent to Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23 owners earlier this year. The new update addresses 59 security vulnerabilities and is tailored for the Galaxy S22 series, including the Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, and Galaxy S22 Ultra. These smartphones bear model numbers SM-S901B, SM-S906B, and SM-S908B. Once the update is available on your phone, you can install it by opening your phone’s Settings app. From there, select the Software Update option followed by Download and install. In May, Samsung rolled out AI features that were first introduced on the Galaxy S24 series to the Galaxy S22 lineup. This included the popular Circle to Search capabilities and a photo-editing toolkit. That update also introduced Live Translate to the lineup, which can translate voice and text during video calls. It also includes Note Assist, which allows for better note formatting and provides automatic summarization. Finally, with Chat Assist, Samsung added tools to improve the text messaging experience, including the ability to check text for spelling and grammar errors. The Samsung Galaxy S22 series was officially released on February 25, 2022, following its announcement on February 9, 2022. It is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which still offers smooth performance in 2024. The Galaxy S22 Ultra was the first Galaxy Ultra phone to ship with an S Pen following the demise of the Galaxy Note series.</p>

                <h1>iOS 18 has a hidden feature you’ll only see when your iPhone battery dies</h1>
                <p>It’s been just a few days since Apple released the first developer preview of iOS 18. Since then, developers and everyday users have discovered features in the first iOS 18 beta that Apple didn’t mention in its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2024) keynote. The most recent discovery concerns what happens when your iPhone’s battery becomes exhausted. Apple iPhones have a power reserve feature that conserves a small amount of battery life to support essential functions like Find My and NFC unlocking when the battery is nearly depleted. In iOS 18, the feature appears to be extended. According to a Reddit post, even when the battery is drained, your iPhone will continue to display the time in the upper-left corner of the screen. You’ll also see a message on the screen that notes, “iPhone is Findable,” as well as a depleted battery icon. MacRumors says the new feature only works on the iPhone 15 and, undoubtedly, the upcoming iPhone 16 series. This limitation is strange given that iPhones back to the iPhone XS have had power reserve functionality. Regardless, it’s nice to discover tiny new features in iOS betas. Earlier this week, we noted that iOS 18 offers a redesigned iPhone flashlight that allows you to make the flashlight beam wider or narrower. There are also plenty of new home screen customization features — some good and some bad. No doubt, much more about iOS 18 will be discovered and discussed during beta testing. This process will likely be extended into September when new iPhones are announced and the first public version of iOS 18 arrives. Apple officially announced iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2 earlier this week. Apple Intelligence will be the most significant update for each of these software updates and their devices. This AI technology from Apple is expected to revolutionize how we interact with our devices by impacting writing, image creation, and search. Siri will also undergo significant changes as part of the Apple Intelligence update.</p>

                <h1>EU charges Apple with tech rule violations</h1>
                <p>The EU antitrust regulators have accused Apple of violating the bloc’s tech rules, potentially leading to a substantial fine. The European Commission, responsible for antitrust and technology regulation, announced its preliminary findings following an investigation initiated in March. That move marks the first charge under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to curb Big Tech’s dominance and foster fair competition. Apple could face fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover if it fails to address the concerns. EU’s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, highlighted issues with Apple’s new terms, which allegedly restrict app developers’ ability to communicate freely with their users and establish contracts. Apple maintains that it has made several changes to comply with the DMA based on feedback from app developers and the Commission. However, the Commission criticised Apple’s business terms, particularly allowing app developers to redirect customers to external websites to complete transactions and the fees charged for initial customer acquisition through the App Store. The Commission is also investigating Apple’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores. Key issues include the core technology fee, the multi-step process to download alternative app stores on iPhones, and eligibility criteria for developers to offer alternative app stores or distribute apps directly. Apple’s recent fee implementations in the EU have drawn criticism, notably from ‘Fortnite’ creator Epic Games. Additionally, Vestager criticised Apple’s delay in launching AI-powered features in the EU, which the company attributed to the DMA, suggesting that Apple might consider its AI integration anti-competitive.</p>
