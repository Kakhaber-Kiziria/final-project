                    <p>Steve Jobs (1955-2011) founded Apple in 1976 with his teenage friend Steve Wozniak in their garage. Thanks to the success of the Apple II, Jobs even made the cover of Time magazine in 1982. <br><br> The succession of emblematic technological products (Mac, iPhone, iPod, iPad,â€¦) for which people have spent the night waiting in line to buy them gives us an idea of the degree of user loyalty and the success of Apple, to the point of often being the company with the highest market capitalization in the world.</p>

                    <p>Bill Gates (b. 1955) founded Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen, while still a student at Harvard University. The origin of the company was to develop and market BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, a microcomputer designed in 1974 and based on the Intel 8080 processor. <br><br> Highlighting everyday products such as Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office, in addition to the acquisitions of Skype or LinkedIn in 2011 and 2016 respectively, Microsoft has once become the company with the largest market capitalization in the world, surpassing Apple.</p>

                    <h1>Jeff Bezos</h1>
                    <p>Jeff Bezos (1964) founded Amazon in 1994 with a name inspired by the Amazon River, the longest river in the world, with the intention of making it the largest store in the world. Although the truth is that this nomenclature came a year later, since the original name was Cadabra. <br><br> And as with Apple, the origin is also in a garage, specifically the one at their home: it was an online bookstore with a catalog of 200,000 books where the novelty was that the copies could be purchased via e-mail, something very common nowadays, but groundbreaking three decades ago.</p>
